                  <p>
                  As a blood donor, you donate one pint of blood, which your body quickly replaces. As someone who is new to donating blood, we encourage you to focus on being a healthy blood donor. Here are a few things you should do to have the best possible experience:</p>
                  Be in good general health and feeling well.
                  Maintaining your iron level is an important part of being a healthy donor. We encourage you to learn more about iron and donating blood
                  Be at least 17 years old in most states (16 years old with parental consent in some states).
                  Weigh at least 110 lbs. Additional height and weight requirements apply for donors 18 years old and younger and all high school student donors.
                  Have not donated blood in the last 56 days.
